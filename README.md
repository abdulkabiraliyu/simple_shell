Project Description: Simple Shell Implementation in C

Title: "C Simple Shell: Building a Basic Command-Line Interpreter"

Overview:
The C Simple Shell project aims to develop a basic command-line interpreter resembling the functionality of a shell, allowing users to execute commands and interact with the underlying operating system. This project will implement core functionalities found in standard shells like Bash or Command Prompt, providing a fundamental understanding of how shells operate.

Features:

Command Execution: Users can input commands (e.g., ls, cd, mkdir) and execute them within the shell.
Input Handling: The shell will process user input, parse commands, and handle various input scenarios (e.g., command arguments, piping, redirection).
Built-in Commands: Implement some basic built-in commands like cd, exit, help, etc., enhancing the shell's usability.
Error Handling: Manage and display appropriate error messages for invalid commands or system-related errors.
Signal Handling: Capture and handle signals, such as interrupt signals (Ctrl+C), improving the shell's robustness.
Support for Shell Scripts: Enable the execution of shell scripts containing multiple commands by implementing script execution functionality.
Implementation Details:

Parsing: The shell will tokenize user input, separating commands and arguments for execution.
Execution: Implementing the logic to execute commands via system calls like execvp() or using the fork() and exec() system calls.
Interactive Interface: Providing a command prompt where users can input commands and receive output.
User Experience: Designing a user-friendly interface, displaying a prompt, handling user input, and presenting command outputs.
Modularity: Structuring the codebase into separate modules for input handling, command execution, and shell functionalities, enhancing maintainability and readability.
Documentation: Including comments, clear variable names, and organized code structure for better understanding and future maintenance.
Potential Extensions:

Environment Variables: Implement support for environment variables like $PATH.
Job Control: Incorporate basic job control features like background and foreground processes.
Customization: Allow customization of the shell through configuration files or settings.
Additional Shell Features: Adding additional functionalities, such as history, tab completion, or scripting enhancements.
Through this project, developers will gain insights into system-level programming, command execution, and handling user input, resulting in a functional and educational simple shell implementation in C.
